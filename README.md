## The Problem

Agent memory hasn't converged. Mem0, Letta, Zep, LangMem — each bakes in a different architecture because the right one depends on your domain and changes as your agent evolves. Most systems force you to commit to a schema early. Changing your approach means migrations or starting over.

## What Synix Does

Conversations are sources. Prompts are build rules. Summaries and world models are artifacts. Declare your memory architecture in Python, build it, then change it — only affected layers rebuild. Trace any artifact back through the dependency graph to its source conversation.

```bash
uvx synix build pipeline.py
uvx synix validate
uvx synix search "return policy"
```

## Key Capabilities

**Incremental rebuilds** — Change a prompt or add new conversations. Only downstream artifacts reprocess.

**Altitude-aware search** — Query episode summaries, monthly rollups, or core memory. Drill into provenance from any result.

**Full provenance** — Every artifact chains back to the source conversations that produced it, through every transform in between.

**Validation and repair** — Detect semantic contradictions and PII leaks across artifacts, then fix them with LLM-assisted rewrites.

**Architecture evolution** — Swap monthly rollups for topic-based clustering. Transcripts and episodes stay cached. No migration scripts.

## Where Synix Fits

| | Mem0 | Letta | Zep | LangMem | **Synix** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Approach** | API-first memory store | Agent-managed memory | Temporal knowledge graph | Taxonomy-driven memory | Build system with pipelines |
| **Incremental rebuilds** | — | — | — | — | Yes |
| **Provenance tracking** | — | — | — | — | Full chain to source |
| **Architecture changes** | Migration | Migration | Migration | Migration | Rebuild |
| **Schema** | Fixed | Fixed | Fixed | Fixed | You define it |

Synix is not a memory store. It's the build system that produces one.
