## Get started in 60 seconds

```bash
uvx synix init my-project
cd my-project
cp .env.example .env              # add your API key
# add your source data to ./sources/
uvx synix build
uvx synix release HEAD --to local
uvx synix search "your query" --release local
```

That's it. You get episode summaries, monthly rollups, a core memory document, and full-text search — with every insight traced back to its source.

## What just happened

Synix processed your sources through a **pipeline** — a directed graph of transforms you define in Python:

1. **Sources** — raw data was parsed from `./sources/`
2. **Episodes** — each source got an LLM-generated summary (1:1)
3. **Monthly rollups** — episodes were grouped by month and synthesized (N:M)
4. **Core memory** — all rollups were compressed into a single document (N:1)
5. **Search index** — everything was indexed for full-text search

The template gave you a working pipeline. When you need to change it — different prompts, different grouping, different layers — you edit `pipeline.py`. Same tool, no migration.

## The problem Synix solves

Memory is harder than it looks. You won't get it right the first time — nobody does. The question is what happens when you need to change it.

Every agent memory tool — Mem0, Letta, Zep, LangMem — gives you one flat bucket. Same storage, same rules, same lifecycle for everything your agent knows. When memory breaks, it breaks silently — contradictions, stale context, hallucinated recall. And when you realize your memory architecture is wrong, you're looking at a migration or starting over.

Synix lets you **program** how memory works — define the layers, write the prompts, control the lifecycle. Change your memory architecture and only affected layers rebuild. Trace any output back to the source that produced it. Your memory system grows with your needs — start simple, course-correct as you learn what works, and never pay for the wrong first guess.

## How your agent uses the output

After `synix release`, your agent queries memory at inference time:

```python
import synix

project = synix.open_project("./my-project")
mem = project.release("local")

# Search memory
results = mem.search("return policy", limit=5)
for r in results:
    print(f"[{r.layer}] {r.label} ({r.score:.2f})")

# Or load core memory as flat context
context = mem.flat_file("context-doc")
# → inject into your agent's system prompt
```

Synix runs offline. Your agent reads the output at runtime. They're decoupled — Synix doesn't need to be running while your agent serves requests.

**Other integration options:** [MCP server](docs/mcp.md) for Claude/Cursor, [CLI](docs/integration.md#option-3-cli-from-automation) for automation, or [direct SQLite access](docs/integration.md#option-4-direct-file-access) to `search.db`. See the [Integration Guide](docs/integration.md).

## Customize everything

The template gave you a default pipeline. Open `pipeline.py` to see what's inside:

```python
from synix import FlatFile, Pipeline, SearchSurface, Source, SynixSearch
from synix.ext import CoreSynthesis, EpisodeSummary, MonthlyRollup

pipeline = Pipeline("agent-memory")
pipeline.source_dir = "./sources"
pipeline.llm_config = {
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "model": "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001",
}

transcripts = Source("transcripts")
episodes = EpisodeSummary("episodes", depends_on=[transcripts])
monthly = MonthlyRollup("monthly", depends_on=[episodes])
core = CoreSynthesis("core", depends_on=[monthly])

memory_search = SearchSurface(
    "memory-search",
    sources=[episodes, monthly, core],
    modes=["fulltext"],
)

pipeline.add(transcripts, episodes, monthly, core, memory_search)
pipeline.add(SynixSearch("search", surface=memory_search))
pipeline.add(FlatFile("context-doc", sources=[core]))
```

Change a prompt → only downstream artifacts rebuild. Add new sources → only new episodes process. Swap `MonthlyRollup` for `TopicalRollup` → source parsing and episodes stay cached. No migrations.

This means you can A/B test your memory architecture. Try topic-based rollups instead of monthly, compare the outputs, keep what works. Every experiment is just a rebuild — not a rewrite.

For custom pipelines beyond the built-in transforms, use the generic transform shapes:

```python
from synix.transforms import MapSynthesis, GroupSynthesis, ReduceSynthesis, FoldSynthesis, Chunk
```

| Transform | Pattern | Use when... |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `MapSynthesis` | 1:1 | Each input gets its own LLM call |
| `GroupSynthesis` | N:M | Group inputs by a metadata key, one output per group |
| `ReduceSynthesis` | N:1 | All inputs become a single output |
| `FoldSynthesis` | N:1 sequential | Accumulate through inputs one at a time |
| `Chunk` | 1:N | Split each input into smaller pieces (no LLM) |

See [Pipeline API](docs/pipeline-api.md) for the full reference.

## Beyond agent memory

The pipeline primitives are general-purpose. Anything that flows through sources → transforms → artifacts works — not just text, not just agents.

**Photo library → searchable life timeline**
```
photos + EXIF metadata
  → MapSynthesis: vision model captions each image
  → GroupSynthesis: cluster by time + location into events ("Japan trip", "birthday party")
  → ReduceSynthesis: compress events into a life timeline
  → SearchSurface: "show me beach photos from last summer"
```
Every search result traces back to the original photo. Swap your captioning model → only captions rebuild. Add 50 new photos → only those 50 process.

**Codebase → architectural memory**
```
git log + PRs + design docs
  → MapSynthesis: summarize each PR/commit into a decision record
  → GroupSynthesis: cluster by module or system area
  → ReduceSynthesis: synthesize into architectural knowledge base
  → SearchSurface: "why did we switch from REST to gRPC?"
```

**IoT sensors → operational knowledge**
```
sensor readings + maintenance logs + incident reports
  → MapSynthesis: extract events from each data stream
  → GroupSynthesis: correlate across sensor clusters
  → FoldSynthesis: build evolving equipment health profiles
  → SearchSurface: "what happened before the last compressor failure?"
```

The pattern is always the same: raw data → structured knowledge → searchable artifacts, with incremental rebuilds and full provenance. The agent memory template is where most people start, but the architecture doesn't care what your sources are.

## Where Synix fits

|                          | Mem0    | Letta   | Graphiti | LangMem | **Synix**       |
|--------------------------|---------|---------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Approach**             | Memory API | Agent-managed blocks | Temporal knowledge graph | Taxonomy extraction | Programmable architecture |
| **You define the rules** | No      | No      | No       | No      | Yes — in Python |
| **Change architecture**  | Migration | Migration | Migration | Migration | Incremental rebuild |
| **Provenance**           | —       | —       | —        | —       | Full chain to source |
| **Memory lifecycle**     | —       | —       | —        | —       | Per-layer rules |
| **Schema**               | Fixed   | Fixed   | Fixed    | Fixed   | You define it   |

Synix is not a memory store. Mem0/Letta/Graphiti store and retrieve memories. Synix is the system that **produces** structured memory from raw sources — conversations, documents, reports, transactions, anything — with full provenance, incremental rebuilds, and an architecture you control.

**When Synix is the right choice:** You want to control how memory is structured, not just store things. You need provenance. You expect your memory architecture to evolve. You want different layers with different rules.

**When something else is better:** You just need a key-value memory store (→ Mem0). You need a knowledge graph (→ Graphiti). You need real-time memory management during inference (→ not yet — planned).

## Current status

- **Stable:** Pipeline definition, build, release, search, provenance, incremental rebuilds, CLI, Python SDK
- **Works but early:** Templates, MCP server for agent integration
- **Experimental:** Validation/repair, batch builds (OpenAI Batch API), distributed builds (mesh)
- **Not built yet:** Real-time runtime, agent-driven memory evolution, multi-tenancy

Synix is a working tool used in production for personal and project memory pipelines. It is pre-1.0 — on-disk formats may evolve with a compatibility path. Solo-maintainer project.

## Architecture direction

Synix is designed around the idea that different kinds of memory need different management — four tiers with distinct physics, from execution context (milliseconds) to identity (permanent). Today, Synix manages the experience tier via programmable pipelines. The architecture is designed to expand across all four tiers — and eventually, agents will program their own memory.
