    "content": "## Identity\nMark is a senior software engineer at a fintech company, currently pursuing a Staff Engineer promotion. He has 3+ years of experience as a senior engineer and is known for both deep technical execution and cross-team leadership. He works primarily in Python but is actively learning Rust.\n\n## Current Focus\nMark's primary professional focus is a PostgreSQL-to-CockroachDB migration for his company's main database (50 tables, heavy read traffic). This migration has evolved from a technical project into his defining Staff Engineer initiative, touching payments, risk, and data teams. He leads a cross-team tiger team and has navigated organizational resistance through strategic piloting and stakeholder management.\n\n## Technical Interests\n- **Databases**: Deep expertise in PostgreSQL, growing expertise in CockroachDB. Understands distributed SQL tradeoffs, serializable isolation, schema migration challenges (SERIAL→UUID), CDC with Debezium, and performance testing under contention.\n- **Rust**: Progressing rapidly from beginner to intermediate. Has built: async migration monitoring tool (tokio), CLI toolkit (clap), TUI dashboard (ratatui). Understands ownership, borrowing, async/await, error handling (thiserror/anyhow), and testing (proptest, criterion).\n- **Python**: Primary language. Uses Click for CLIs, SQLite for local storage, matplotlib for visualization. Building a CLI expense tracker as a side project.\n- **Infrastructure**: Monitoring (Grafana + Datadog), backup/DR strategies, CI/CD with GitHub Actions.\n\n## Career Strategy\nMark chose Staff Engineer over Engineering Manager because he wants to solve hard technical problems while shaping org-wide approaches. His strategy:\n1. Use the CockroachDB migration as his Staff portfolio centerpiece (cross-team impact, technical depth, organizational leadership)\n2. Write RFCs and design docs to build communication skills\n3. Open-source his expense tracker for community credibility\n4. Build influence through 30-60-90 day cadence: learn pain points, propose improvements, ship and measure\n\n## Key Relationships\n- Reports to (implied) an engineering director who offered the Staff/Manager choice\n- Works with risk team's director (initially resistant to migration, won over through pilot strategy)\n- Leads a tiger team with representatives from payments, risk, data, and platform teams\n\n## Preferences & Style\n- Prefers practical, project-driven learning (learns Rust by building real tools, not tutorials)\n- Values simplicity over complexity (chose rules.json over ML for expense categorization)\n- Thinks in systems and phases (migration phased approach, 30-60-90 career plan)\n- Careful about organizational dynamics (lets stakeholders claim wins, proposes low-risk pilots)\n\n## Active Threads\n1. **CockroachDB migration**: In final stages — cutover runbook created, data validation designed, monitoring operational. Cutover planned for a Saturday with full team standby.\n2. **Staff Engineer promotion**: Building portfolio through migration leadership, RFC writing, and cross-team influence. Operating at Staff level in practice.\n3. **Rust migration toolkit**: Unified CLI with db-compare, db-monitor, schema-validate subcommands. TUI dashboard for real-time monitoring.\n4. **Expense tracker**: Feature-complete with OCR, visualization, budgets, multi-currency. Planning open-source launch with blog post.\n5. **Writing**: Migration retrospective (internal + public blog), RFC for CockroachDB migration, tech talk on migration lessons.",
