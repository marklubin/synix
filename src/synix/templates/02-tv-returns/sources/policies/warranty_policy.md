# Warranty & Manufacturer Claims Policy

**Effective Date: January 1, 2026**

## Our Role in Warranty Claims

We are an authorized retailer, not the manufacturer. Our role in warranty claims is limited:

- **We do NOT process warranty claims or replacements on behalf of manufacturers**
- **We do NOT accept returns for defective items past our standard return window**
- We will provide proof of purchase documentation upon request to support your warranty claim with the manufacturer

## How Warranty Works

When you purchase a product from us, the manufacturer's warranty is between **you and the manufacturer**. If you experience a defect:

1. Contact the manufacturer directly (see your product documentation for contact info)
2. The manufacturer will troubleshoot, authorize a repair, or issue a replacement
3. If the manufacturer requires proof of purchase, contact us and we will email you a copy of your receipt

## Important Distinction

**Manufacturer warranty ≠ our return policy.** These are separate:

| | Store Return | Manufacturer Warranty |
|---|---|---|
| Time window | Per our return policy (15-30 days) | Per manufacturer (typically 1-2 years) |
| Reason | Any reason (buyer's remorse OK) | Defects only |
| Process | Through our returns portal | Through manufacturer support |
| Refund/replacement | Refund to original payment | Repair or replacement from manufacturer |
| Who pays shipping | We provide prepaid label | Varies by manufacturer |

## Extended Protection Plans

We offer optional extended protection plans at checkout through our partner, ShieldPlus:

- Extends coverage beyond manufacturer warranty
- Covers accidental damage (drops, spills, power surges)
- One-click claims through your account
- Plans available for 2-year or 3-year terms
