# Acme Analytics — Q1 2026 Competitive Intelligence Update

**Classification: Internal — Sales Team Only | Date: February 10, 2026**

## Pricing Changes

Acme Analytics announced a significant price reduction effective February 1, 2026:

- **Standard tier**: reduced from $35/seat/month to $25/seat/month (29% cut)
- **Enterprise tier**: reduced from $65/seat/month to $50/seat/month (23% cut)
- Existing customers will be migrated to new pricing at their next renewal

This is notable because Acme's new Standard pricing of $25/seat/month now matches NovaSight's Starter tier exactly. However, NovaSight's Starter tier includes 10 data connectors vs Acme's 5, and our Professional tier ($55/seat) still offers custom ML models and API access that Acme lacks at any price point.

## New Product Features

- **Custom Dashboard Templates Marketplace**: launched January 2026, allows users to share and download dashboard templates. Currently has 180 community-contributed templates. This is a differentiation risk for our out-of-the-box templates value proposition.
- **Enhanced API**: expanded from 40 to 65 endpoints, now includes write access for dashboard management. Still significantly behind NovaSight's 200+ endpoints but closing the gap.

## Competitive Win/Loss Shifts

Acme lost 3 enterprise deals to NovaSight in Q4 2025:

- **RetailMax** (300 seats): Acme lost on API capabilities; our REST API was the deciding factor
- **CloudServe** (180 seats): Acme lost on custom ML models; their Standard tier could not match our Professional offering
- **MedTech Solutions** (450 seats): Acme lost on enterprise security; their SSO implementation issues were flagged during POC

These wins represent $485K in combined ARR for NovaSight.

## Leadership Change

Acme announced a new CEO on January 22, 2026: **Maria Torres**, previously SVP of Enterprise Sales at Salesforce. She replaces co-founder Jake Mitchell, who moves to a Chief Strategy Officer role.

This leadership change signals a likely enterprise pivot:

- Torres spent 8 years at Salesforce building their enterprise sales motion
- Her LinkedIn post mentioned "building Acme into the enterprise analytics standard"
- Expect increased investment in enterprise features (SSO, compliance, support tiers)
- Potential risk: Acme may become more competitive in the enterprise segment within 12-18 months

## Key Risks for NovaSight

1. **Pricing pressure**: Acme's $25/seat Standard tier matches our Starter tier, which may force us to compete more aggressively on price in the mid-market segment
2. **Enterprise pivot**: with Torres leading, Acme will likely accelerate enterprise feature development — our 12-18 month lead on enterprise features may narrow
3. **Template marketplace**: community-contributed templates could become a competitive moat if they gain traction; consider whether NovaSight should launch a similar marketplace

## Recommended Sales Responses

- **On pricing**: emphasize total value — NovaSight Professional at $55/seat includes ML models, 200+ API endpoints, and SSO that Acme cannot match at $50/seat Enterprise
- **On new features**: acknowledge the marketplace but pivot to our unique capabilities (custom ML, hybrid deployment, anomaly detection)
- **On leadership change**: use this as urgency — "Acme is restructuring; do you want to bet on a company in transition or a stable platform?"
