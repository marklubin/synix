# Past Win: TechFlow Industries

**Deal closed: August 2025 | Deal ID: TF-2025-0089**

## Customer Profile

TechFlow Industries is a mid-market industrial automation company based in Minneapolis, MN. Annual revenue: $1.4B. Total employees: 6,800. Their analytics team had 400 licensed users and 35 power users who built dashboards and reports. They were migrating from a Tableau Online deployment that had been in use since 2020.

## Competitive Landscape

TechFlow evaluated three vendors:

- **NovaSight Analytics** (winner) — Professional tier
- **DataFlow Inc** — Enterprise platform
- **Acme Analytics** — Enterprise tier

## Why We Won

### 1. POC Excellence

We ran a 2-week proof of concept that demonstrated custom ML model deployment using TechFlow's actual production data. Their data science team uploaded a demand forecasting model (Python, scikit-learn) and had it running on live manufacturing data within 3 days. Neither DataFlow nor Acme could replicate this during their POCs.

### 2. Implementation Speed

We committed to a 3-week implementation timeline and delivered in exactly 3 weeks. The customer had expected a 3-month implementation based on their experience with Tableau and DataFlow's proposed 5-month timeline. This was a decisive factor for their VP of Operations, who needed the platform live before their Q4 planning cycle.

### 3. API Capabilities

TechFlow needed to integrate analytics into their internal ERP system. Our 200+ REST API endpoints and clear OAuth 2.0 documentation allowed their engineering team to build the integration during the POC itself. DataFlow's API was limited to data ingestion only.

## Objection Handling

The primary objection was vendor size and stability:

- **Objection**: "Your company is smaller than DataFlow. How do we know you'll be around in 5 years?"
- **Response**: We highlighted our 99.9% uptime SLA (with financial penalties), SOC2 Type II certification, $85M in funding, 35% YoY growth, and our dedicated Customer Success team. We also provided references from 3 similar-sized manufacturing customers.
- **Outcome**: CTO was satisfied after speaking with 2 of our reference customers.
