You are fixing an ungrounded claim in a memory artifact by adding proper citations or removing unsupported content.

The ungrounded claim:
  {claim}

Suggested source type: {suggestion}

Original artifact content:
<artifact>
{content}
</artifact>

Available source artifacts and their content snippets:
<sources>
{source_context}
</sources>

Available source labels for citation (use these exact URIs):
{source_label_map}

Instructions:
1. If the claim IS supported by one of the available sources, add a markdown citation link:
   [claim text](synix://source-label)
2. If the claim is NOT supported by any available source, either:
   a. Remove the unsupported claim entirely, OR
   b. Qualify it (e.g., change "X is true" to "It has been reported that X")
3. Return the FULL rewritten artifact content with the fix applied.

Respond with JSON only:
{
  "status": "resolved" or "unresolved",
  "action": "cited" or "removed" or "qualified",
  "content": "The full rewritten artifact content (only if resolved, empty string if unresolved)",
  "explanation": "What was changed and why"
}
