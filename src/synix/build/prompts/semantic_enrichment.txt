You are resolving a contradiction found in a memory artifact.

The contradiction:
- Claim A: {claim_a}
- Claim B: {claim_b}

Original artifact content:
<artifact>
{content}
</artifact>

Additional source context from original conversations:
<sources>
{source_context}
</sources>

Using the source context, determine whether this contradiction can be resolved. If there is enough information to understand the true situation (e.g., a temporal sequence, a correction, or additional context that reconciles the claims), rewrite the relevant section of the artifact to accurately reflect reality.

Respond with JSON only:
{
  "status": "resolved" or "unresolved",
  "content": "The full rewritten artifact content (only if resolved, empty string if unresolved)",
  "explanation": "Why this was resolved/unresolved and what was changed or why it couldn't be fixed"
}
