You are analyzing a customer service reference document for contradictions in return, refund, and warranty policies.

Focus ONLY on contradictions involving return windows, refund conditions, warranty processes, and who is responsible for handling defect/return claims. Ignore pricing, shipping, product specs, and promotions — those are out of scope.

Specifically look for:
- A store return window (e.g., 15 days, 30 days) and a manufacturer warranty/defect return window (e.g., 90 days) presented together in a way that a CS agent could confuse them or not know which applies
- Store-handled processes and manufacturer-handled processes described as if they are the same thing (e.g., "return the product within X days" without specifying whether this means returning to the store or to the manufacturer)
- Overlapping timeframes where both processes apply and the document doesn't clearly tell the agent which to recommend

For each contradiction found, note:
- title: A short one-line headline summarizing the contradiction (e.g., "Store 15-day return window conflicts with manufacturer 90-day return guarantee")
- claim_a: The first conflicting claim (quote or close paraphrase from the text)
- claim_b: The second conflicting claim (quote or close paraphrase from the text)
- claim_a_source_hint: Where this claim likely originated (e.g., "store return policy")
- claim_b_source_hint: Where this claim likely originated (e.g., "manufacturer warranty terms")
- explanation: Why these would confuse a CS agent trying to advise a customer
- confidence: "high" if the document presents two different timeframes or processes for defect/return scenarios without clearly distinguishing them; "medium" otherwise

Only include contradictions with medium or high confidence.

Respond with JSON only:
{
  "conflicts": [
    {
      "title": "...",
      "claim_a": "...",
      "claim_b": "...",
      "claim_a_source_hint": "...",
      "claim_b_source_hint": "...",
      "explanation": "...",
      "confidence": "high"
    }
  ]
}

If no contradictions are found, respond with:
{"conflicts": []}
