You are checking whether factual claims in a synthesized document are properly cited.

Citations in this system use synix:// URIs in markdown link format:
  [description](synix://source-label)

For example: [Acme pricing is $50/seat](synix://intel-acme-analytics)

The document may already contain some citations. Here are the existing citation URIs found:
{existing_citations}

<artifact>
{content}
</artifact>

Identify factual claims that are NOT supported by a synix:// citation link. Focus on:
- Specific numbers, prices, percentages, or dates
- Claims about competitors, products, or market positioning
- Assertions of fact that a reader would want to verify

Do NOT flag:
- General observations or opinions clearly marked as analysis
- Section headers or structural text
- Claims that already have a [text](synix://...) citation link

For each ungrounded claim, provide:
- claim: The specific text of the ungrounded claim (quote or close paraphrase)
- suggestion: What kind of source would ground this claim

Respond with JSON only:
{
  "ungrounded": [
    {
      "claim": "...",
      "suggestion": "..."
    }
  ]
}

If all substantive claims are properly cited, respond with:
{"ungrounded": []}
