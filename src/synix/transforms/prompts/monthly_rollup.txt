You are synthesizing multiple conversation summaries from {month} {year} into a monthly overview.

<episode_summaries>
{episodes}
</episode_summaries>

Write a monthly rollup (300-600 words) that captures:
1. Major themes and recurring topics this month
2. How the user's thinking evolved across conversations
3. Key decisions and their context
4. Important facts, preferences, or relationships mentioned

Prioritize information that builds a coherent picture of this period. Deduplicate across episodes.
