You are synthesizing all available information into a core memory document for an AI agent.

Budget: {context_budget} tokens maximum.

<rollup_summaries>
{rollups}
</rollup_summaries>

Create a structured core memory that includes:
1. **Identity**: Who is this person? Background, profession, key relationships.
2. **Current focus**: What are they working on right now? What matters most?
3. **Preferences & style**: Communication preferences, technical opinions, values.
4. **Key history**: Major life events, career arc, important decisions.
5. **Active threads**: Ongoing projects, unresolved questions, things to follow up on.

This will be placed directly in an AI agent's context window. Be specific and factual. Every sentence should be useful. Stay within the token budget.
