**Last updated: January 2026**

## Company Overview

InsightCorp was founded in 2023 by former Google and Anthropic engineers. The company raised a $4M seed round in March 2023 and a $18M Series A in January 2025 led by Benchmark. Current estimated ARR is approximately $5M, growing at 25% quarter-over-quarter. Total headcount is 47 employees, with 30 in engineering. Headquartered in New York, NY.

## Core Product

InsightCorp's product is an AI-native analytics platform built around natural language queries. Users type questions in plain English ("What was our revenue trend in EMEA last quarter?") and the system generates visualizations and written summaries. The product is designed for business users who lack SQL skills. Built on a modern stack using LLMs for query generation and interpretation.

## Pricing

- **Single tier**: $15/seat/month (billed monthly or annually)
- No enterprise tier currently available
- 30-day free trial with full feature access
- Aggressive startup discounts: 50% off for YC companies
- No minimum seat count

## Strengths

- Modern, intuitive UX — average user creates first report in under 5 minutes
- Natural language query interface is best-in-class (accuracy benchmarked at 87%)
- Fast product iteration: shipping weekly releases, 200+ features launched in 2025
- AI-first architecture means features like anomaly detection and forecasting are native
- Strong developer community and active Discord server (3,200 members)

## Weaknesses

- Limited feature set compared to mature platforms: no custom ML models, no embedded analytics
- No enterprise security features: no SSO, no SAML, no audit logs, no role-based access
- Fewer than 50 employees — customers worry about vendor viability and bus factor
- Only 20 data connectors available (vs 50+ for Acme, 150+ for DataFlow)
- No SOC2 certification (in progress, expected Q2 2026)
- Young product: first GA release was September 2024, limited track record
- No on-premises deployment option; US-only data residency

## Market Position

InsightCorp holds approximately 2% market share overall but is growing rapidly in the SMB segment (companies under 100 employees). Their market share in SMB analytics is closer to 8%. G2 rating: 4.6/5 (120 reviews). Not yet rated on Gartner Peer Insights.
