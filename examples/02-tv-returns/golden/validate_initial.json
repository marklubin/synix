a defect faces ambiguity: the store policy says opened items are subject to a 
15% restocking fee and only unopened items qualify for returns, but the 
manufacturer warranty says any unit within 90 days can be returned for full 
refund with no restocking fee. The document does not clearly state whether an 
opened but defective item within 15 days should go through the store (with 
restocking fee) or directly to Samsung (with no fee). A CS agent could 
incorrectly advise applying the 15% restocking fee when the manufacturer 
warranty would actually apply.",

claims and that defective items are not eligible for store returns after 15 
days. However, it does not explicitly state whether a defective item discovered 
within the 15-day window should be handled by the store or routed directly to 
Samsung. This creates confusion about whether a CS agent should attempt to 
process a defect claim through the store's 15-day return process (with 
restocking fees) or immediately escalate to Samsung's warranty process (with no 
fees). The phrase 'after 15 days' implies the store might handle defects within 
15 days, but this contradicts the statement that the store does not process 
warranty claims.",
