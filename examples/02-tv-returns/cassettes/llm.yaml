    text: '# Warranty & Manufacturer Claims Policy – Key Rules


      **Effective Date:** January 1, 2026


      ---


      ## Store''s Role & Responsibilities


      - Store does NOT process warranty claims or replacements on behalf of manufacturers

      - Store does NOT accept returns for defective items beyond the standard return window

      - Store will provide proof of purchase documentation upon request to support manufacturer warranty claims

      - Proof of purchase requests: Call 1-888-555-SHOP with order number


      ## Warranty Claims Process


      - Manufacturer warranty is between customer and manufacturer (not the store)

      - Customer must contact manufacturer directly for defects

      - Manufacturer handles troubleshooting, repair authorization, and replacements

      - If manufacturer requires proof of purchase, customer must request receipt from store (provided via email)


      ## Return Policy vs. Manufacturer Warranty (Key Distinction)


      **Store Return Window:**

      - 15–30 days (per store return policy)

      - Any reason accepted (including buyer''s remorse)

      - Process through store returns portal

      - Refund issued to original payment method

      - Store provides prepaid shipping label


      **Manufacturer Warranty:**

      - Typically 1–2 years

      - Defects only

      - Process through manufacturer support

      - Repair or replacement from manufacturer

      - Shipping cost varies by manufacturer


      ## Extended Protection Plans


      - Optional ShieldPlus extended protection plans available at checkout

      - Extends coverage beyond manufacturer warranty

      - Covers accidental damage (drops, spills, power surges)

      - One-click claims available through customer account

      - Available terms: 2-year or 3-year plans


      ---


      ## Important Exceptions & Conditions


      - Defective items are **not eligible for store returns** after the standard return window expires; manufacturer warranty
      applies instead

      - Extended protection plans are optional add-ons with separate terms'

      \ or 1-888-555-SHOP\n\n---\n\n## RETURNS, DEFECTS & WARRANTY\n\n### SCENARIO 1: Customer Wants to Return (Any Reason)\n\
      \n**Return Window:** 15 days from delivery  \n**Condition:** Unopened, factory-sealed items only  \n**Refund:** Full\
      \ refund to original payment method  \n**Restocking Fee:** None for unopened items\n\n**Process:**\n1. Initiate return\
      \ via online account (Order History → Return Item)\n2. Prepaid return shipping label will be provided\n3. Refund processed\
      \ within 5–7 business days of receipt\n\n**Important Notes:**\n- Opened items are subject to 15% restocking fee\n- All\
      \ original accessories, cables, remote controls, and documentation must be included\n- Mounting hardware, wall brackets,\
      \ and installation accessories are non-returnable once opened\n\n---\n\n### SCENARIO 2: Item Arrives Damaged\n\n**Report\
      \ Timeline:** Within 48 hours of delivery (critical)  \n**Required Documentation:** Photos of damage and packaging \
      \ \n**Resolution:** Replacement shipment or full refund at no cost  \n**Important:** Accept the delivery even if damaged;\
      \ report damage afterward for fastest resolution\n\n**Process:**\n1. Contact customer service: 1-888-555-SHOP\n2. Provide\
      \ order number and damage photos\n3. Samsung will arrange replacement or refund\n\n---\n\n### SCENARIO 3: Item is Defective\
      \ (After 15-Day Return Window)\n\n**Manufacturer Warranty Coverage:**\n- **90-Day Satisfaction Guarantee:** Any unit\
      \ may be returned to Samsung within 90 days of purchase for full refund or replacement — no restocking fee, no questions\
      \ asked\n- **1-Year Limited Warranty:** After 90 days and within 1 year, Samsung will repair defective units at no cost\n\
      \n**Important Distinction:**\n- Store return policy (15 days) is separate from manufacturer warranty (90 days + 1 year)\n\
      - Defective items are NOT eligible for store returns after 15 days; manufacturer warranty applies instead\n- Store does\
      \ NOT process warranty claims on behalf of Samsung\n\n**How Customer Should Proceed:**\n1. Contact Samsung support directly:\
      \ **1-800-SAMSUNG**\n2. Samsung handles all troubleshooting, repair authorization, and replacements\n3. If Samsung requires\
      \ proof of purchase, customer can request receipt from store by calling **1-888-555-SHOP** with order number\n4. Store\
      \ will provide proof of purchase documentation via email\n\n---\n\n## KNOWN ISSUES & VENDOR NOTES\n\n**Vendor Note (Important\
      \ Context):**  \nCustomer john.smith@gmail.com reported minor banding on 2024 batch — **resolved in current production\
      \ run**\n\n**CS Agent Context:** This was a display banding issue on earlier units. Current inventory has been corrected.\
      \ If a customer reports banding, this is likely a defect and should be escalated to Samsung warranty support (1-800-SAMSUNG)\
      \ within the 90-day satisfaction guarantee window for immediate replacement.\n\n---\n\n## ADDITIONAL DETAILS FOR CS\
      \ AGENTS\n\n### Price Adjustments\n- If customer purchased within 7 days and price has dropped further, they are eligible\
      \ for a one-time price adjustment\n- Process: Contact customer service to request\n\n### Extended Protection (Optional)\n\
      - ShieldPlus extended protection plans are available\n- Covers accidental damage (drops, spills, power surges) beyond\
      \ manufacturer warranty\n- Available terms: 2-year or 3-year plans\n- One-click claims available through customer account\n\
      \n### Proof of Purchase\n- Provided via email upon request\n- Required for: Manufacturer warranty claims, price adjustments,\
      \ or returns\n- Call 1-888-555-SHOP with order number to request\n\n### Contact Numbers\n| Purpose | Number |\n|---------|--------|\n\
      | Store Customer Service | 1-888-555-SHOP |\n| Samsung Warranty/Support | 1-800-SAMSUNG |\n| Order Tracking | shopexample.com/orders\

      \ refund, process via online portal\n\n**Item arrived damaged?**  \n→ Report within 48 hours with photos, replacement\

      \ (Any Reason)\n\n**Return Window:** 15 days from delivery  \n**Condition:** Unopened, factory-sealed items only  \n\
      **Refund:** Full refund to original payment method  \n**Restocking Fee:** None for unopened items\n\n**If Opened:**\n\
      - 15% restocking fee applies\n- All original accessories, cables, remote controls, and documentation must be included\n\
      - Mounting hardware, wall brackets, and installation accessories are non-returnable once opened\n\n**How to Return:**\n\
      1. Initiate return via online account (Order History → Return Item)\n2. Prepaid return shipping label will be provided\n\
      3. Refunds processed within 5–7 business days of receipt\n\n**Important:** Drop-ship returns may require shipping to\

      \n**Report Damage/Defects Within:** 48 hours of delivery  \n**Required:** Photos of damage and packaging  \n**Resolution:**\
      \ Replacement shipment or full refund at no cost\n\n**Important:** Customer should accept the delivery even if damaged,\
      \ then report damage afterward for fastest resolution.\n\n---\n\n### SCENARIO C: Defect Discovered After 15-Day Return\

      \ and timeframes. The 15-day window is the store's return policy for unopened items, while the 90-Day Satisfaction Guarantee\
      \ is Samsung's manufacturer warranty that covers defects discovered after the store return window closes (up to 90 days).\
      \ The artifact has been updated to explicitly clarify that the 90-Day Satisfaction Guarantee applies to defects discovered\
      \ within 90 days of delivery, even if outside the 15-day store return window, and to emphasize that customers should\
      \ contact Samsung (not the store) for warranty claims after day 15. This reconciles both claims as complementary rather\
      \ than contradictory.\"\n}\n```"
